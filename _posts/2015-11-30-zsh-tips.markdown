These are some Zshell tips and tricks that I have found helpful:

Many people have mappings for CTRL-R to reverse search their history of commands, but sometimes you want to search for a command to use as a parameter. For instance, I frequently am half way through writing one command when I want a part of another. You can do this with the following:
{% highlight bash %}
% cat /some/file/I/want/to/reuse
% grep term !?reuse<tab> # Would expand to "grep term cat /some/file/I/want/to/reuse"
% grep term !?reuse?:1 # Would expand to "grep term /some/file/I/want/to/reuse"
{% endhighlight %}

Search/Replace on command history. Say you want to change one thing about the previous command that was run:
{% highlight bash %}
% grep fred list_file
% ^fred^joe^ # Would either run or expand (depending upon enter or tab termination) to: grep joe list_file
{% endhighlight %}
